## Overview

Lending Club is "the worldâ€™s largest online credit marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing for elective medical procedures. Borrowers access lower interest rate loans through a fast and easy online or mobile interface. Investors provide the capital to enable many of the loans in exchange for earning interest." (https://www.lendingclub.com/public/about-us.action)

Using the data provided by Lending Club for loans issued between 2007 and 2011 (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action), this project creates dynamic maps of mean loan amounts, interest rates and annual incomes of loan recipients.

## Statebins

This project uses the R package statebins to create stylized choropleths of the data. 
For example, the map of mean annual income by state of recipients of loans (Node: embedded R code is being run to create this map): 

``` {r echo=FALSE }
library(statebins)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(BH)
df3 = read.csv("df3.csv")

## calculate means
df4<-df3 %>%
  group_by(addr_state) %>%
  summarise(meanrate = mean(int_rate),
            meaninc = mean(annual_inc),
            meanamt = mean(loan_amnt) 
  )
loaninfo<-df4
loaninfo<-transform(loaninfo, addr_state = as.character(addr_state))
names(loaninfo)<-c("state","meanrate","value","meanamt")
chartinc<-loaninfo[,c("state", "value") ]

statemap<-statebins_continuous(chartinc, brewer_pal="YlGnBu",
                text_color="black", font_size=3, 
                legend_title="by Annual Income", legend_position="bottom")+ 
                guides(fill = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 20, barheight = 1))

      
statemap

```

## Discussion

This project might be of interest to those who want to be able to compare levels of income against interest rates assigned or against loan amounts.

## Future Development

Future functionality could be developed allowing the user to pick specific time periods of interest or to be able to see more than one map at a time.
